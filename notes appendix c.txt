Appendix C:  Deriving characteristic motion parameters from registered flight data:
Describes parameters on how to attach numerical values to aperiodic and oscillatory characteristic motions
Aperiodic = time constant
Oscillatory =T(1/2) and P with formulas on how to construct them from eigenvalues <- to be used for validation


Comparing the measured time responses to simulated time histories:
Were we actually allowed to linearize the equations of motion? (validation)
Proof of match: compare the output of the model to reality (using the same input) <- reason for the flight test. We can make a proof of match plot in python for each of the eigenmotions
Use C1-C3 as model, note that it's only valid at the nominal point as it depends on (c.g. location, mass, moment of inertia,  air density, airspeed
CL calculation, Cx0 calculation, Cz0 calculation
Assumption: (except for CL, Cx0, Cz0) all stability derivatives are assumed to be independent of true airspeed Vt0 and of pressure altitude hp in the stationary flight condition
